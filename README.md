# SpotiMix 🎶

A single-page web app that blends the top tracks of up to 3 artists into one shuffled Spotify playlist. Artist discovery is powered by Last.fm; playback and playlist saving use the Spotify Web API.

## How it works

1. Search for up to 3 artists via Spotify
2. Choose a track mode: **Top Hits**, **Deep Cuts**, **Mix**, or **Discovery**
3. Set how many tracks per artist (1–10)
4. Hit **Generate SpotiMix** — Last.fm fetches the tracks, Spotify matches and plays them
5. Click any track to play from that point; the current track is highlighted automatically
6. Save the result as a Spotify playlist or add it directly to your queue
7. Save your favorite artist combinations as combos for quick recall

### Track modes

| Mode | Source |
|------|--------|
| Top Hits | Last.fm ranks 1–10 by scrobble count |
| Deep Cuts | Last.fm ranks 11–50 by scrobble count |
| Mix | Half top hits, half deep cuts |
| Discovery | Your artists + 2 tracks each from 3 similar artists |

- Copy the Client ID

### 2. Configuration

Open `js/config.js` and update the two constants:

```js
const SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_spotify_client_id';
const LASTFM_API_KEY    = 'your_lastfm_api_key';

## Notes

- Requires a **Spotify Premium** account for playback and queue management
- Deep Cuts quality depends on how well-scrobbled an artist is on Last.fm
- Spotify matching can occasionally miss tracks with non-standard characters; unmatched tracks are skipped with a warning
