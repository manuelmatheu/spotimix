# SpotiMix 🎶

A single-page web app that blends tracks from artists, genres, and moods into shuffled Spotify playlists. Two ways to mix: pick artists manually, or let genre tags and mood presets build it for you. Artist discovery powered by Last.fm, playback and playlists via Spotify Web API, with an embedded in-browser player.

## How it works

### Artist Mix
1. Search for up to 3 artists via Spotify
2. Use **Smart Suggest** — genre tags and similar artists auto-fill remaining slots
3. Choose a track mode: **Top Hits**, **Deep Cuts**, **Mix**, or **Discovery**
4. Hit **Generate SpotiMix** — Last.fm fetches tracks, Spotify matches and plays them

### Tag Mix
1. Switch to **Browse genres** tab
2. Pick a **mood preset** (Melancholy, Late Night, Dreamy, etc.) or select up to 3 genre tags
3. Hit **Generate Tag Mix** — tracks sourced directly from Last.fm tags, matched on Spotify
4. No artist selection needed — the genre defines the mix

### Both flows share
- Embedded in-browser player with album art, controls, seekable progress bar
- Click any track to play from that point
- Save to Spotify playlist or add to queue
- Heart/like button saves tracks to Spotify Liked Songs
- "About this mix" liner notes with genre tag chips
- Interleave shuffle (no consecutive same-artist tracks)
- Save artist combos for quick recall

### Track modes (Artist Mix)

| Mode | Source |
|------|--------|
| Top Hits | Spotify search — current popularity-ranked tracks |
| Deep Cuts | Last.fm ranks 11–50 by scrobble count |
| Mix | Half Spotify top tracks + half Last.fm deep cuts |
| Discovery | Your artists' top tracks + 2 tracks each from similar artists |

### Mood presets (Tag Mix)

| Mood | Tags | Auto-mode |
|------|------|-----------|
| 🌧 Melancholy | sad, melancholy, ambient | Deep Cuts |
| 🌙 Late Night | electronic, chillwave, synthwave | Mix |
| ☀️ Sunday Morning | acoustic, folk, singer-songwriter | Top Hits |
| ⚡ Raw Energy | punk, garage rock, post-punk | Top Hits |
| 💭 Dreamy | shoegaze, dream pop, ethereal | Deep Cuts |
| 🎷 Soul Kitchen | soul, funk, rnb | Mix |
| 🎧 Deep Focus | post-rock, minimal, instrumental | Deep Cuts |
| 🍷 Midnight Jazz | jazz, smooth jazz, bossa nova | Mix |
| 🤘 Headbanger | metal, heavy metal, thrash metal | Top Hits |
| 🌴 Tropicália | latin, bossa nova, tropicalia | Mix |

## Setup

### 1. Spotify app

- Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Create an app and select "Web Playback SDK" + "Web API"
- Add your deployment URL as a Redirect URI (e.g., `https://spotimix-app.vercel.app/`)
- Copy the Client ID

### 2. Configuration

Open `js/config.js` and update the two constants:

```js
const SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_spotify_client_id';
const LASTFM_API_KEY    = 'your_lastfm_api_key';
```

Get a free Last.fm API key at [last.fm/api](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).

### 3. Deploy

Push to GitHub and connect to Vercel (or any static hosting). No build step needed.

## Notes

- Requires a **Spotify Premium** account for playback and the embedded player
- Deep Cuts quality depends on how well-scrobbled an artist is on Last.fm
- Embedded player streams audio in the browser tab (desktop). Mobile falls back to remote control.
- Spotify matching can occasionally miss tracks with non-standard characters; unmatched tracks are skipped with a warning

## Changelog

### v1.9
- Saved combos collapse past four, with a "+N more" chip to expand the rest — the picker stays navigable with a large library, and the expanded/collapsed choice is remembered
- "New Mix" is now a two-state toggle: press it again ("↑ Back to mix") to collapse the picker and put the current mix back in full view

### v1.8
- Hybrid track sourcing: Top Hits and Discovery now pull from Spotify search (current popularity) instead of Last.fm all-time scrobbles — mixes feel fresher and more current
- Mix mode blends Spotify top tracks + Last.fm deep cuts in parallel

### v1.7
- Cloud-Synced Combos: saved artist combos persist across devices via Supabase
- Automatic merge + dedup on login (local + cloud)

- Heart/like button: save tracks to Spotify Liked Songs
- Hearts on both player bar (current track) and track list rows

### v1.5
- Embedded player: Spotify Web Playback SDK streams audio directly in-browser
- Persistent player bar: album art, track info, prev/play/next, seekable progress, volume
